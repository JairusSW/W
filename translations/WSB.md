1. How to eliminate Brute Force attacks with W Lang!

```js
real_password be "bussin"

side_quest check_password
    grab password: word

    cuz password be real_password,

        say "i call cap"
    idgaf
        say "frick. kms"
end side_quest

main_character do side_quest
```

Translated to Boomer Lang:

```
let's say the real password is "bussin"

we need to go on a side quest to see if its legitimate.

    if the password be real password,
        we say "nocap"
    but if the password is not real,
        we say "i call cap"
    but if all else fails,
        we say "idgaf"

we complete the side quest
```

Translated to Boomer Lang:

```
we need to go on a side quest to crash this computer.

    if the system is linux (good),
        we say "that's awesome!"
    but if the system is dead,
        we say "probably was a mac"
    but if all else fails, 
        we say "its windows. please initiate crash sequence."

we complete the side quest
```
