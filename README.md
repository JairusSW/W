# W Lang

Esoteric language based off of Genz slang cuz why not?

## Inspiration

We love diversity, but we only have two types of developers!
1. The C developer
    - Can move mountains
    - Packs features into a single commit, not 10+
    - Deserves their job
2. The Python Bootcamper
    - Best friend is the clipboard
    - Dies without ChatGPT
    - Doesn't understand compilers

Because of this, we introduce a third category to the catalog of developers!
Introducing W, the language of the future!

W lets Gen Z to simply speak in their natural language and become a developer! As the younger Gen Zs get influenced by brain rot, we include them by using simple words like `cap`, `sus`, and `npc`, empowering the next generation to code with minimal brain activity!

**Take the W, not the L!**

## But, why W be takin the W's?
- Never crash again! Just use the `#idgaf` tag on your function!
- Why use booleans when we have `nocap` and `cap` instead?
- Never use `switch` to check your `case`! Use `vibe check`s instead!
- Need to check truthiness/falsiness? Use `smol` (<), `thicc` (>), `be` (==), `be special` (!==) instead!
- Want an empty pointer that acts like any value? Use the `stuf` keyword instead!
- We all hated functions in school, so we made `side_quest`s instead!
- TF is a `string`? We just use `word` here.
- Tests not passing? Make them all turn green with the `#yolo` and `#idgaf` tags!
- Something evaluating to false? Detect it with the `sus` operator!
- Anyone using `main()`? Start using `main_character`, boomer!
- In tutorial hell dying over `if/else`? We got you with easy-to-understand `cuz`, `frick`, and `idgaf` keywords!
- Find yourself using `/*` and `*/` to knock out shitcode? Use `nah, stop that` and `continue here`!
- Need a loop? Just spawn an NPC instead with `spawn npc called bob rn` to do your bidding!
- Proper error handling! Instead of `Result<T>`, we use `W's` and `L's`! (`cuz side_quest take L, say "side quest failed!"`)
- At W, we decide to have a different flavor just for the stanley girls! Now includes words like `slayy`, `yass`, `queen`, and `ick`!

1. How to eliminate Brute Force attacks with W Lang!

```js
real_password be "bussin"

side_quest check_password
    grab password: word

    cuz password be real_password,
        say "nocap"
    frick password be sus
        say "i call cap"
    idgaf
        say "frick. kms"
end side_quest

main_character do side_quest
```

2. How to crash your friend's computer with W Lang!

```js
side_quest crash_computer
    system_vibe: word

    vibe_check on system_vibe:
        cuz system_vibe be "linux",
            say "sys too lit to quit fam!"
        frick system_vibe be "wsl",
            say "best of both?",
        frick system_vibe be "dead",
            say "prolly was a mac"
        idgaf
            say "windows ðŸ’€"
            pls initiate_crash_sequence rn
end side_quest

main_character do side_quest
```

This is a joke if you want me to make this real, leave an issue telling me to make it real
