# W Lang

Esoteric language based off of Genz slang cuz why not?

## But, why W be takin the W's?
- Never crash again! Just use the `#idgaf` tag on your function!
- Why use booleans when we have `W's` and `L's` instead?
- Never use `switch` to check your `case`! Use `vibe check`s instead!
- Need to check truthiness/falsiness? Use `smol` (<), `thicc` (>), `be` (==), `be special` (!==) instead!
- Want an empty pointer that acts like any value? Use the `stuf` keyword instead!
- We all hated functions in school, so we made `side_quest`s instead!
- TF is a `string`? We just use `word` here.
- Tests not passing? Make them all turn green with the `#yolo` and `#idgaf` tags!
- Something evaluating to false? Detect it with the `sus` operator!
- Anyone using `main()`? Start using `main_character`, boomer!
- In tutorial hell dying over `if/else`? We got you with easy-to-understand `cuz`, `frick`, and `idgaf` keywords!
- Find yourself using `/*` and `*/` to knock out shitcode? Use `nah, stop that` and `continue here`!
- Need a cron job? Just spawn an NPC instead with `spawn npc called bob rn`
- At W, we decide to have a different flavor just for the stanley girls! Now includes words like `slayy`, `yass`, `queen`, and `ick`!
- Get bored on the job? Utilize W's full use of emojis!
